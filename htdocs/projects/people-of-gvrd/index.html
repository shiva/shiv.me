I walk around Greater Vancouver, and ask random strangers for their permission to photograph them. There is no real motive, except to force myself to engage more with my surroundings, to talk to people, and hopefully having something interesting to share.

For now, this is just a placeholder, until I get my act right, and make this a more interesting site to visit.  For now, all of the pictures <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/shvelmur/sets/72157627148158599/">will be hosted on flickr</a>.<br />

If you are, one of the people I met during my walks, thanks a ton for being open to listen to what I had to say, and for being part of this little experiment of mine. It was a pleasure to meet you.  Don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:shiv@shiv.me">contact me</a>. If you have objections to the use of your picture, shoot me an email, and I will do my best to satify your request.
